You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

### javascript

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
 
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World');
})
 
app.listen(3000);
```

### python

```python
from flask import Flask
 
app = Flask(__name__)
 
@app.route('/')
def hello():
   return 'Hello world!'
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run()
```
